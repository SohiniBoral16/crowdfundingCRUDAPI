**Agenda:**

1. **Relationship Hierarchy Modeling in PIPEX**

   We need to model the following two tables to show the relationship hierarchy in PIPEX:

   - **Table 1:** `binaryRelationshipHierarchy` (New Table)
     - Columns:
       - `HierarchyRelationId`
       - `RelatedParty`
       - `ParentParty`
       - `OwnershipPercentWithActualParent`

   - **Table 2:** `binaryRelationshipHierarchyLinkage` (New Table)
     - Columns:
       - `binaryRelationshipID`
       - `hierarchyRelationshipID`

   The primary focus of the discussion will be on the approach and requirements for the above model.

We look forward to discussing the above approach in detail.
