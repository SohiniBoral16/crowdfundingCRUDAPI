**Subject:** Issue with Rendering the P2P PIPEX Screen

Dear P2P Development Team,

As discussed during our last meeting, we encountered an issue where the PIPEX P2P screen fails to launch in certain scenarios. Below are the steps to replicate the problem:

1. Access the PIPEX P2P screen using the following link: [PIPEX P2P Screen](https://pipexprod-webstack.webfarm.ms.com/#/party-relationships?partyId=BBB00332287)
2. The error persists with the case ID: **DDR-91575**.

Please find attached a screenshot that illustrates the issue. 

We would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
